# Virto Commerce Mobile
Mobile starter kit for developing e-commerce related apps using Virto Commerce API. It is developed using ionicframework.com, angularjs and cordova.

Simple configuration (good for modifying simple html)
--------------

1. Download Ionic Lab http://lab.ionic.io/
2. Open project in Ionic Lab using File->Open Existing application and then selecting root of the vc-mobile repository (due to bug, Ionic Lab will still display starter page, so simply click create new project and then hit esc and you should see the list of apps).
3. Select "virtoshop" app from the list and click "serve", you will now be able to see the full mobile application and can also open it in the browser. All updates to html, js will be automatically synchronized.
4. Now open the project in your favourite development tool (VS, VS Code, ...) and start modiying files under www folder.
